## Executive Summary

With the demand for higher food yields and use of our resources, we must now worry about our carbon emissions and the effect it has had on our food yields, changes in land temperatures, and the ability of the average individual to purchase the necessary products. In this study, the emissions of products affecting global temperatures was studied along with its relation to rising land temperatures and food costs; likewise, agricultural yields were measured from 2016 to 2023 to determine if global warming has had any effect on production.


Questions

What trends have emission intensities and total emissions followed per each source?

How have food costs changed as emissions and food yields change?

Which country gives the individual the most purchasing power for food?

How has the change in emissions change the yield in food sources?

Has employment changes as a result of increasing emissions? Causation is not correlation

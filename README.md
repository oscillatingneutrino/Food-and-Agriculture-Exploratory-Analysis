## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of green house emissions from different sources and their effects on land temperatures, food yields, producer pricing, and affordability. The intent of this report is to inform the reader of the trends followed by metrics representative of the sustainability of modern agricultural practices for Mexico, Canada, and the United States.

This report analyzes emisssion data, temperature data, producer pricing, and rates of unaffordability from 2016 to 2023. It presents a granular analysis of different food and emission sources, which are key to determining the efficiency of each agricultural practice. The findings presented in this study are key to understanding what to expect with the increased and continued emissions of green house gases into the atmosphere.

Through this study, it was discovered that:
* **Agricultural Yields:** Have remained consistent both on individual products and on an overall level; minimal variance was observed for each country observed.
* **Land Temperatures:** Recently, land temperatures have seen a stark increase and are expected to continue rising for Canada and Mexico, but not for the United States; currently, the change in land temperature is observed to be 1 °C higher for Canada when compared to the United States and Mexico.
* **Total Emissions:** The median emissions for the United States for all sources is approximately 400kt higher than that of Canada and Mexico, but dropped to 38% of its value from 2021 in 2023. The total emissions for Canada has started to rise, while that of Mexico has seen a minimal decrease.
* **Agricultural Yields:** There is minimally observed variance in the overall agricultural yield, although some sources (i.e. green corn, potatoes) have seen increases in yields.
* **Emission Intensity:** Although on a downward trend, the intensity of emissions has remained more or less constant except for Cereals excluding rise, which had as much as a 75% dropoff in value.
* **Unaffordability of a Healthy Diet:** The affordability of a healthy diet has increased for Mexico, experienced minimal decreases for Canada, and stark increases for the United States.
* **Producer Prices:** The producer prices of Mexico heavily outweigh those of the United States and Mexico combined; across the board, all agricultural products have seen increases in producer prices; only green coffee from the United States has a higher producer price than that of Mexico (a difference of value of 36,000 standard local currency).
*  **Inflation in Food Pricing:** From 2016 to 2022, inflation continued to increase, but begun decreasing thereafter by as much as 52% (USA).

Currently, it is inacorrect to state that increases in the changes in land temperature have had any impact on agricultural yields and costs of food; other factors, including those that involve current economic policies and trends in international trading have likely had effects on changes pricing; likewise, although emissions have seen changes for Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the data for other countries was not included and is likely to have a greater impact than those from the studied country.

## Project Background

## Trend In Total Yield

By analyzing the dashboard dedicated to trends in product yield, the minimal variance per product and as a total depict consistent results in yield. On occasion, one will note specific drop offs or slight increases in the yield. One must understand that these changes occur while increases in land temperature and emissions continue to rise. This implies that changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have led to overall increases in agricultural yields. This therefore lends to the conclusion that higher temperatures are not entirely responsible for changes in the yield and that there are other factors at play. Such factors include temporary droughts, degradation in the condition of soil, and changes in agricultural practices.


## Explanation of Differences in Product Pricing
When analyzing the chart, one can note that the product prices for Mexico far exceed those of their northern neighbors. This trend is due to a variety of factors that affect all facets of the agricultural business in Mexico, which, although at first glance may give the appearance that farming in Mexico is an incredibly lucrative business, farmers earn less than their american counterparts.

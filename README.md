## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of green house emissions from different sources and their effects on land temperatures, food yields, producer pricing, and affordability. The intent of this report is to inform the reader of the trends followed by metrics representative of the sustainability of modern agricultural practices for Mexico, Canada, and the United States.

This report analyzes emisssion data, temperature data, producer pricing, and rates of unaffordability from 2016 to 2023. It presents a granular analysis of different food and emission sources, which are key to determining the efficiency of each agricultural practice. The findings presented in this study are key to understanding what to expect with the increased and continued emissions of green house gases into the atmosphere.

Through this study, it was discovered that:
* **Agricultural Yields:** Have remained consistent both on individual products and on an overall level; minimal variance was observed for each country observed.
* **Land Temperatures:** Recently, land temperatures have seen a stark increase and are expected to continue rising for Canada and Mexico, but not for the United States; currently, the change in land temperature is observed to be 1 °C higher for Canada when compared to the United States and Mexico.
* **Total Emissions:** The median emissions for the United States for all sources is approximately 400kt higher than that of Canada and Mexico, but dropped to 38% of its value from 2021 in 2023. The total emissions for Canada has started to rise, while that of Mexico has seen a minimal decrease.
* **Agricultural Yields:** There is minimally observed variance in the overall agricultural yield, although some sources (i.e. green corn, potatoes) have seen increases in yields.
* **Emission Intensity:** Although on a downward trend, the intensity of emissions has remained more or less constant except for Cereals excluding rise, which had as much as a 75% dropoff in value.
* **Unaffordability of a Healthy Diet:** The affordability of a healthy diet has increased for Mexico, experienced minimal decreases for Canada, and stark increases for the United States.
With the increased demand for higher food yields for a growing population, we must now worry about our carbon emissions and the effect it has had on our food yields, changes in land temperatures, and the rising costs. In this study, the emissions of products affecting global temperatures was studied along with its relation to rising land temperatures and food costs; likewise, agricultural yields were measured from 2016 to 2023 to determine if global warming has had any effect on production.


Questions

What trends have emission intensities and total emissions followed per each source?

How have food costs changed as emissions and food yields change?

Which country gives the individual the most purchasing power for food?

How has the change in emissions change the yield in food sources?

Has employment changes as a result of increasing emissions? Causation is not correlation

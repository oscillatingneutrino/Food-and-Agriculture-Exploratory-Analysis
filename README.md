## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of green house emissions from different sources and their effects on land temperatures, food yields, producer pricing, and affordability. The intent of this report is to inform the reader of the trends followed by metrics representative of the sustainability of modern agricultural practices for Mexico, Canada, and the United States.

This report analyzes emission data, temperature data, producer pricing, and rates of unaffordability from 2016 to 2023. It presents a granular analysis of different food and emission sources, which are key to determining the efficiency of each agricultural practice. The findings presented in this study are key to understanding what to expect with the increased and continued emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Through this study, it was discovered that:
* **Land Temperatures:** Recently, land temperatures have seen a stark increase and are expected to continue rising for Canada and Mexico, but not for the United States; currently, the change in land temperature is observed to be 1 °C higher for Canada when compared to the United States and Mexico.
* **Total Emissions:** The median emissions for the United States for all sources is approximately 400 kt higher than that of Canada and Mexico, but dropped to 38% of its value from 2021 to 2023. The total emissions for Canada have started to rise, while that of Mexico has seen a minimal decrease.
* **Agricultural Yields:** There is minimally observed variance in the overall agricultural yield, although some sources (i.e. green corn, potatoes) have seen increases in yields.
* **Emission Intensity:** Although on a downward trend, the intensity of emissions has remained more or less constant except for Cereals excluding rise, which had as much as a 75% dropoff in value.
* **Unaffordability of a Healthy Diet:** The affordability of a healthy diet has increased for Mexico, experienced minimal decreases for Canada, and stark increases for the United States.
* **Producer Prices:** The producer prices of Mexico heavily outweigh those of the United States and Mexico combined; across the board, all agricultural products have seen increases in producer prices; only green coffee from the United States has a higher producer price than that of Mexico (a difference of value of 36,000 standard local currency).
*  **Inflation in Food Pricing:** From 2016 to 2022, inflation continued to increase, but began decreasing thereafter by as much as 52% (USA).

Overall, since the agricultural yield for multiple products has remained at constant levels and even shown to increase for some products, the analysis performed did not demonstrate a sensitivity or a strong correlation between rising emissions and increases in temperatures to changes in agricultural yield; despite this, costs of food and increased producer pricing was shown to increase, likely a result of economic policies or other external factors potentially including international trade.

## Project Background
This project used data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations's publically available datasets, which provide standardized economic data and agricultural/environmental indicators. This project focuses specifically on data for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This analysis made use of Excel, Tableau, and MySQL to filter, sort, and visualize the provided data.

## Trend in Total Agricultural Yield

Agricultural yield has remained at consistent levels despite increases in changes in land temperature and total emissions. The release of greenhouse gases, the rises in global temperature, and the consequent effects this process has had on the environment is more nuanced and outside of the scope of this project, but the NASA article, "*Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Will Help and Hurt Crops*" describes how the increases in the concentration of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere may have the effect of mitigating yield losses while also increasing water use efficiency through the increase in the rate in photosynthesis; this effect, however, does not overshadow any negative effects caused by increased Carbon Dioxide emissions.

As stated previously, the analysis conducted displayed a low sensitivity between agricultural yield and total emissions and rising land temperatures. The behavior of each of the mentioned quantities is likely to be a sum of other factors not included or portrayed by the data being used. For instance, higher yields could be a result in the increase of the quality of the soil being used, or better farming practices.


## Explanation of Differences in Product Pricing
When analyzing the chart, one can note that the product prices for Mexico far exceed those of their northern neighbors. This trend is due to a variety of factors that affect all facets of the agricultural business in Mexico, which, although at first glance may give the appearance that farming in Mexico is an incredibly lucrative business, farmers earn less than their American counterparts.

I would like to thank the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for their provision of the data that made this project possible.
